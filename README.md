# FAIR-principles
A repository containing a computable representation of the FAIR principles

The FAIR Principles have been encoded as a nanopublication. This representation breaks each of the FAIR principles and sub-principles into citable components. This computable representation of the FAIR principles are published on the World Wide Web using purl.org's HTTP URI scheme. The purl.org represents a persistent scheme. Purl.org is provided by the Internet Archive, which is devoted to creating retrievable snapshots. The nanopublication is also processed by the trusty URI system, which indicates when the content of that document has changed. We also use github to version documents, and therefore previous version of the principles can be retrieved.
