# FAIR-principles
A repository containing a computable representation of the FAIR principles

The FAIR Principles have been encoded as nanopublications. This representation breaks each of the FAIR principles and sub-principles into citable components. This computable representation of the FAIR principles are published on the World Wide Web using w3id.org's HTTP URI scheme, representing a persistent scheme. The nanopublications are also given trusty URIs, which indicates when the content of that document has changed. We also use GitHub to version documents, and therefore previous version of the principles can be retrieved. 

The code to generate the nanopublications (including trusty URIs and the index) can be found [here](https://github.com/peta-pico/FAIR-nanopubs).
